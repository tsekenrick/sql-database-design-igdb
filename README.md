# SQL Database for IGDB API Scrape Results
For this assignment, we were asked to create a SQL database to model the results of our queries from a previous assignment ([found here](https://github.com/tsekenrick/api-data-extraction-and-analysis)).
After desgining the model, we imported our data from the .csv generated in the previous assignment and ran some SQL queries on our data,
and then did a brief writeup.
